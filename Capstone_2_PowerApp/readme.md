# Divergence Academy: Data Science Immersive Course

## Capstone 2: Power App

### Summary
The student is required to create an app in Power Apps, preferably with some other integrations with Microsoft technology. My app includes Microsoft
SharePoint, Microsoft Power Automate, and Microsoft Power BI. The purpose of the app is to replace a paper-based Student Attendance process. Once the student
registers in the app, they can check-in and check-out each school day, and the app provides an attendance report in the form of an embedded Power BI tile.
